# SimpleForum

Simply a place to chat.


## About
SimpleForum is exactly what it sounds like - a simple forum. To learn more about some of the features, go to - [simpleforum.jvadair.com](https://simpleforum.jvadair.com) or read the source code :)
## Support

For support, email dev@jvadair.com or use the [help forum](https://simpleforum.jvadair.com/help/view).


## Run Locally

Running the project locally isn't recommended, but it shouldn't be any harder than downloading the program and replacing the SMTP server and email in the sendmail.py file. Then you can simply run the main.py file.

## FAQ

#### What is SimpleForum

Read your question again.

#### Why would I want to use it?

SimpleForum has several interesting features and a small mostly unmoderated community. It also benefits from security through obscurity - it will be hard for others to find a forum if you give it a really long name...

In all reality this was created as part of a school English project in which I attempted to make a web chat/forum to tie into my main idea. It has continued to evolve since, eventually becoming a way for me to test and develop new skills.

#### Is the source up-to-date with the site?
The answer is most likely **no.** This wasn't created to be a self-hosted server, and updates are created separately and uploaded periodically.
## What's planned
I've written a few ideas into the TODO line at the top of the main.py file. Feel free to leave feedback!
## Site updates
For updates/news visit the [updates forum page](https://simpleforum.jvadair.com/updates/view) - a moderator only page (no spam here!)
## What hasn't been uploaded:
- forum.pyndb (all messages ever sent)
- login.pyndb (all login credentials (obviously not going to upload these...))
- mailing_list.pyndb (who's subscribed to what forums with which emails)
- .smtp_password (My email password)
- names of email servers
- old files no longer in use (main.py.old, etc)
- Pages used to test/play with certain functions before using them (/ts/<test>)
## Disclaimers
I used an online email generator to create the email templates. Shame on me.
